## Installation
1. Extract the master to `\public\themes\` of your Redmine folder.  
2. The theme is yet in a pre-release state, which means, currently:
* CSS isn't included in the master, and you will have to compile the CSS from `application.scss` file in `stylesheets` folder yourself, using any free SASS/SCSS compiling tool.
* You will need to rename `theme-source.js`, located in the `javascripts` folder to `theme.js`

___
## Customization
The theme was developed using SASS/SCSS, which you can customize and recompile, with tools like e.g. [Koala](http://koala-app.com/), in order to modify the colors.

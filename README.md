## Installation
1. Extract the master to `\public\themes\` of your Redmine folder.  
2. The theme is yet in a prerelease state, which means, CSS isn't included in the master, and you will have to compile the CSS from `application.scss` file in `stylesheets` folder yourself, using any free SASS/SCSS compiling tool.

## Customization
The theme was developed using SASS/SCSS, which you can customize and recompile, in order to modify the colors.
